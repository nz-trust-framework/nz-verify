# NZ Verify Sandbox Test Instance – Terms and Conditions of Use

## 1. Introduction

1.1 These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern access to and use of the NZ Verify Sandbox Test Instance (“the Sandbox”) by credential issuers (“Participants”) for testing purposes. By accessing or using the Sandbox, you agree to comply with these Terms.

## 2. Purpose

2.1 The Sandbox is provided solely to credential issuers to test that their credentials are verifiable by the NZ Verify mobile application during development of their credential. It is not intended for production use or for processing real personal data.

## 3. Accreditation Pathway

3.1. Participation in the Sandbox does not provide any form of recognition, approval, or accreditation under the New Zealand Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (the "Trust Framework"). Testing in the Sandbox is not part of, nor does it contribute to, the Trust Framework accreditation process.

3.2. However, participants may use the NZ Verify Sandbox environment to support demonstrations or walkthroughs as part of their Trust Framework accreditation evaluation.

## 4. Shared Environment Disclaimer
  4.1. The Sandbox is a shared testing environment. Certificates added by participants may be verifiable by other participants.
  4.2. No participant will have access to the data, credential payloads, or artefacts of any other participant.
  4.3. NZ Verify has implemented controls to restrict visibility of participant activity to the NZ Verify team at the Department of Internal Affairs. Limited access may be extended to authorised support personnel only when required to resolve a technical issue.

## 5. Anonymity and Data Handling Recommendations

5.1. If participants wish to remain anonymous during testing, they are strongly advised to:
-  Anonymise any IACA or root certificates used in the test environment.
-  Use anonymised or generic email accounts rather than identifiable business or personal emails.

5.2. Participants should not use real personal data or production information in the Sandbox.

## 6. Support and Monitoring

6.1. NZ Verify may monitor use of the Sandbox to ensure operational stability and to support issue resolution.

6.2. Support teams may be granted temporary access to relevant test logs or metadata in the event of a reported problem.

## 7. Security and Availability

7.1. The Sandbox is provided “as-is” with no additional guarantees regarding availability, performance, or security.

7.2. NZ Verify may make changes or updates to the Sandbox environment at any time and without prior notice.

## 8. Participant Responsibilities

8.1 Participants agree to:
-  Use the Sandbox only for verifying credential compatibility with the NZ Verify app.
-  Avoid any actions that interfere with the testing activities of others.
-  Ensure secure handling of their test credentials, access tokens, and test accounts.

## 9. Amendments
9.1  NZ Verify may revise these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Sandbox following any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 10. Contact and Support
10.1  For support or questions about Sandbox use, please contact the NZ Verify team at NZVerifyApp@dia.govt.nz.
